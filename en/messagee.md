## Message

Action Form allows you to set actions to display confirmation and error messages after the user submits the form. With these actions you can use tokens, for example \[Name\], and My Tokens to apply a confirmation message in the Message text box. Every form should have a confirmation message in order to inform the user whether the form data was successfully sent or if there were any errors.
