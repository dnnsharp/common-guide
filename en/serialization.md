# Code Actions {#code}

Code actions will allow you to execute pieces of code\(SQL, RazorScript,...\) and bring new data to your thread of action by using one of the following actions:

* [**Apply Tokens**](/apply-token.md)
* [**Execute Javascript**](/execute-javascript.md)
* [**Execute Token**](/execute_token.md)

Both **Apply Tokens **and** Execute Token **are used to bring new data needed for the actions that follow and their functionality is similar to the [**Inject Form Data**](/inject_form_data.md) action
