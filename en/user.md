# User

In the "*User*" tree, you have the following actions: User Login, User Registration, Update User Profile, Grant User Role, Revoke User Role, Clear User Cache.

## User Login

Action Grid allows you to require the user to be logged in to view and edit the grid. You also can use this action on a grid button to log in a user when clicks on the button - this is a simple form with username and password fields. Note that the form must contain the Username and Password fields so the User Login action applied to the button to work.

## User Registration

Action Grid allows you to specify an action for creating user account when the user clicks on a button which uses this action. This action sets the email address as the username. This option is only applicable for new users. User Registration Options:
Username, Password and Email Fields
In these drop down lists you can choose from the fields added on the grid to determine which field will be called when the action from the button is executed.
Generate random password
Enable this option to have DNN Api Endpoint generate a random password. This basically replaces the password fields. The generated password is stored in [RegRandomPass] token so you can use it for example in an email action.
Send standard DNN registration email
When this option is enabled DNN Api Endpoint will use the standard registration email from DNN. For custom emails, disable this option and add Email actions.
