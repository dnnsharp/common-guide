## Credentials Store

The Credential Store feature gives a secure management solution shared between DnnSharp Modules. It has the capability to store log-in credentials \(username, password, etc.\) for different necessary credentials type \(eg. ConnectionString, SMTP, PayPal, IMAP Account, etc.\). It's designed to enable users to add credentials without communicating with an admin panel. 

All credentials entries can contain different combinations of data \(simple string, email - password combination\) which are saved with an unique identification number - Entry id. Of course, custom data can be added for each entry \(eg. for the ticketing IMAP trigger each credential entry can have information about what department receives the ticket\).  

The entries are grouped into Credentials Group for an easier way to process them.  

Credential store supports the following actions: 

* [Add IMAP Credentials](/credential-store/add-imap-credential.md) useful for the 
* [Update IMAP Credentials](/credential-store/update-imap-credential.md) useful for the 
* [Delete Credentials](/credential-store/delete-credential.md)
* [Get Credentials](/credential-store/get-credential.md)
