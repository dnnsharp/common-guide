### Upload Form Data (AJAX)

Sends current context back to the browser, updating the form fields.

Using this Action you can edit the following fields:

* **Description**. A short description for the action. Only admins will be able to see this field.
* **Error Message**. An error message that will be displayed in case if a error occurs in this action.
* **Condition**. This boolean expression is used to determine if this action will execute. Use it to enable or disable actions programatically. For example, you'd enable a **ShowError** action only if you've found an error let's say when you parsed a response from a web service. A common example is **[SomeField] == "Some Value"**. This field supports **My Tokens**.
