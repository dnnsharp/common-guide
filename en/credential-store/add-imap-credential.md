## Add IMAP Credentials

The Add IMAP Credentials action provides the possibility to append a new set of IMAP Credentials to an existing Group. This can be done for example using [Action Form](http://www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/modules/action-form-builder) or [Action Grid Module](http://www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/modules/action-grid-table-data).

Each added entry receives a unique identification number that can be stored into a token name. Specify a token name to save the EntryId response into. You can access it later using the token syntax, for example \[MyNamedEntryIdToken\].  All added data are inserted into the DnnSharp\_CredentialStoreData Database Table.

The bellow properties can be added for a Credential Entry:
