## Delete Credential

Through the Delete Credential action a given entry can be removed. This can be done using one of our popular modules: [Action Form](http://www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/modules/action-form-builder) or  [Action Grid Module](http://www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/modules/action-grid-table-data). 

**Entry ID **- the unique identifier of the entity wanted to be removed. This field supports [My Tokens](http://www.dnnsharp.com/dnn/modules/my-custom-tokens).
