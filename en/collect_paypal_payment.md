# Collect PayPal Payment

This action allows you to set a PayPal payment requirement when the request is made. To set this requirement you will need to add the **Collect Paypal Payment** action. It allows you to set PayPal payments by submitting your Sandbox Account Email, Live Account Email, Payment Amount, Payment Frequency, and Currency preference. You can also apply tokens to the email addresses, item title and payment amount fields. 

The **Collect Paypal Payment** action allows you to set the requirement before giving the user access to specific resources or rights. When an HTTP request is made, the redirect to the PayPal website should be made, where you should be able to complete the payment process. The user is required to log in to complete the payment process, but if he does not have a Paypal account, is required to create one.
