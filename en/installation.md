# Installation

To install {{book.name}}, you need to have at least one of the following base modules: Action Form, Action Grid, DNN API Endpoint, Sharp Scheduler, or InfoBox.

The following steps will guide you on installing and setting up the {{book.name}} add-on. 

If you don't already have them, you can download the above-mentioned modules from our [website](http://www.dnnsharp.com/). You will not be able to install the add-on if you don't have one or more of these modules, and the DNN installer will display a relevant error.

Once you have one of these modules, you can proceed with installing the DNN MailChimp extension. Install it from Host > Extensions, just as you would any other extension.
