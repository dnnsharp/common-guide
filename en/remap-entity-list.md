# Remap Entity List

This action allows you to overwrite an existing entity list by remapping its properties using a preexisting mapping entity list.

For a better understanding of what this action can do we've prepared the following example based on the existing Entity1 and a remapping based on Mapping\_Entity.

What we did in this example is to:

* rename FirstName to FN and LastName to LN 
* add a new property called FullName that includes both First and Last Name.
